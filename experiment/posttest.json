			"question": "What are the two conditions believed to be required for the formation of igneous rocks?",
			"answers": {
				"a": "Low temperature and molten state",
				"b": "Molten state and very high temperature",
				"c": "Molten state and moderate temperature",
				"d": "Crystallized state and moderate temperature"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "Explanation ",
				"b": "Explanation :A very high temperature and a molten state are, two very important conditions for the original material from which the igneous rocks are believed to have been formed",
				"c": "Explanation ",
				"d": "Explanation "

		{
			"question": "The plutonic rocks are formed at depths below the earthâ€™s surface ranging",
			"answers": {
				"a": "10 to 100 km",
				"b": "100 to 200 km",
				"c": "7 to 10 km",
				"d": "1 to 5 km"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "Explanation ",
				"b": "Explanation ",
				"c": "Explanation:Plutonic rocks are the igneous rocks formed at considerable depths, generally between 7-10 km below the surface of the earth.",
				"d": "Explanation "

		{
			"question": "The rock is coarse grained in",
			"answers": {
				"a": "Volcanic rocks",
				"b": "Plutonic rocks",
				"c": "Hypabyssal rocks always",
				"d": "1 to 5 km"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "Explanation ",
				"b": "Explanation :Because of a very slow rate of cooling at the depths, the rocks resulting from magma are coarse grained. These rocks get exposed on the surface of the earth as a consequence of erosion of the overlying strata",
				"c": "Explanation ",
				"d": "Explanation "
			},
			"correctAnswer": "b",
			"difficulty": "beginner"
		},
		{
			"question": "The rocks which exhibit mixed characteristics of volcanic and plutonic rocks are ",
			"answers": {
				"a": "Intermediate rocks",
				"b": "Mixed rocks",
				"c": "Hypabyssal rocks",
				"d": "Secondary rocks"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "Explanation ",
				"b": "Explanation ",
				"c": "Explanation:The hypabyssal rocks are the igneous rocks which are formed at intermediate depths, generally up to 2 km below the surface of the earth and exhibit mixed characteristics of volcanic and plutonic rocks.",
				"d": "Explanation "

			"question": "The type of concordant body whose thickness is much smaller than its length and width is  ",
			"answers": {
				"a": "Sill",
				"b": "Phacolith",
				"c": "Dyke",
				"d": "Laccolith"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "Explanation :It is typical of sills that their thickness is much small than their width and length. Moreover, this body commonly thins out or tapers along its outer margins. ",
				"b": "Explanation ",
				"c": "Explanation  ",
				"d": "Explanation "

		{
			"question": "The upper and lower margins of sills are relatively  ",
			"answers": {
				"a": "Coarser grain size",
				"b": "Medium grain size",
				"c": "Finer grain size",
				"d": "Can be of any size"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "Explanation ",
				"b": "Explanation ",
				"c": "Explanation: The upper and lower margins of sills commonly show a comparatively finer grain size than their interior portions.",
				"d": "Explanation "
